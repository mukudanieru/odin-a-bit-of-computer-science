# Odin: A Bit of Computer Science

The _"A Bit of Computer Science"_ section is part of the JavaScript course in The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript path. In this section, I revisited and deepened my understanding of key computer science concepts that Iâ€™ve learned in my actual CS class.

## Projects Completed

1. **[Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)**  
   In this first project, I explored two classic problems that leverage the concept of recursion: **Fibonacci** and **Merge Sort**.
2. **[Linked Lists](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)**  
   In this project, I revisited **Linked Lists** by implementing a **Node** class with value and nextNode properties, and a LinkedList class featuring these functions:
    - append(value): add node to end
    - prepend(value): add node to start
    - size(): return total nodes
    - head(): return first node
    - tail(): return last node
    - at(index): return node at given index
    - pop(): remove last node
    - contains(value): check if value exists
    - find(value): return index of value or null
    - toString(): represent list as string
3. **[HashMap](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap)**  
   In this project, I revisited **HashMap** but this time, implementing the growth functionality to dynamically resize the hash table when the load factor threshold is exceeded.
    - hash(key): takes a key and produces a hash code with it
    - set(key, value): add or update key-value pair
    - get(key): retrieve value by key
    - has(key): check if key exists
    - remove(key): delete key-value pair
    - length(): return total entries
    - clear(): remove all entries
    - keys(): return array of all keys
    - values(): return array of all values
    - entries(): return array of key-value pairs
4. **[Binary Search Tree](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees)**
