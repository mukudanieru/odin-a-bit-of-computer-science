# Odin: A Bit of Computer Science

The _"A Bit of Computer Science"_ section is part of the JavaScript course in The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript path. In this section, I revisited and deepened my understanding of key computer science concepts that Iâ€™ve learned in my actual CS class.

## Projects Completed

1. **[Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)**  
   In this first project, I explored two classic problems that leverage the concept of recursion: **Fibonacci** and **Merge Sort (NOT DONE YET LOL)**.
