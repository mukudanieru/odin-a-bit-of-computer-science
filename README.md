# Odin: A Bit of Computer Science

The _"A Bit of Computer Science"_ section is part of the JavaScript course in The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript path. In this section, I revisited and deepened my understanding of key computer science concepts that Iâ€™ve learned in my actual CS class.

## Projects Completed

1. **[Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)**  
   In this first project, I explored two classic problems that leverage the concept of recursion: **Fibonacci** and **Merge Sort**.
2. **[Linked Lists](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)**  
   In this project, I revisited linked lists by implementing a Node class with value and nextNode properties, and a LinkedList class featuring these functions:
    - append(value): add node to end
    - prepend(value): add node to start
    - size(): return total nodes
    - head(): return first node
    - tail(): return last node
    - at(index): return node at given index
    - pop(): remove last node
    - contains(value): check if value exists
    - find(value): return index of value or null
    - toString(): represent list as string
